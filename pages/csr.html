              <h4>Animal Health CSR Project ‘Gouraksha”</h4>
              <br>
              <h6>Introduction</h6>
              <p>India is endowed with world’s largest number of bovine animals – more than 300 mio cattle and buffaloes. Unfortunately, it also has a very large number of abandoned and destitute animals though are no confirmed statistics or census existing on the size of stray or destitute cattle in the country. It is estimated that there nearly one thousand five hundred Goushala’s and Pinjarpoles in India who try to shelter and care for these abandoned animals. However, most of these institutions do not have sufficient funds to treat animals or prevent them from various diseases. As a result, these animals are not only malnourished, but also are carriers of various diseases. They are the potential source of spread of disease, especially air borne diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease, parasitic diseases etc. These animals are also frequently ignored by governments’ vaccination and health coverage campaigns.</p>
              <h6>Objective</h6>
              <p>Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL) as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has planned to provide assistance for health coverage to destitute and orphaned cattle in select states.</p>
              <h6>Beneficiaries</h6>
              <p>As per Department of Animal Husbandry Dairying & Fisheries (DADF), Ministry of Agriculture, number of Goushalas and Pinjarapole societies housing such destitute animals in the country is very large, nearing at least a thousand.  Shifting animal population in such places makes it difficult to make correct estimates of animals housed in these shelters. A rough estimate is about one million animals in such goushalas across the country.  We plan to survey these Goushalas and Pinjarapole societies on their animal health coverage status and financial strength before short listing them for our CSR activity.</p>
              <h6>Summary of progress</h6>
              <p>The CSR activity “Operation Gouraksha” is aimed at providing free deworming and vaccination to destitute animals. Most of these destitute animals are housed in charitable Goushalas and Pinjrapole societies across the country. The project is concentrated majorly in remote areas where the veterinary services are inadequate.</p>
              <p>In line with the objectives of this project, we are servicing 1.05 lakhs of animals sheltered in 176 Goushalas spread across 12 states namely AP, Telangana, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, MP, UP, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Haryana.</p>
              <h6>Conclusion</h6>
              <p>In line with the ancient Indian philosophy, “Service to animals is service to God”. IIL has always been in the forefront of service to the animals and dairy farmers. IIL now wishes to adopt health coverage of destitute animals free of cost as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). IIL expects to cover at least 15% of these destitute animals across the country through this CSR activity by fifth year.</p>
