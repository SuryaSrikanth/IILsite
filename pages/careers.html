        Human Resources Practices at Indian Immunologicals are driven, as are every other activity of the Organization, by its DNA of being a socially conscious, research driven, farmer oriented Organization. We believe that farmers and the larger community deserve the best which can only be delivered by a committed team of exceptional individuals. The Human Resources mandate is to attract committed individuals, retain the best of them and groom them to current and future roles, in tune with requirements of the Community and Organization.</p>

We believe that farmers and the larger community deserve the best even in this era of competition. Therefore, while performance matters, it needs to be delivered within the context of values we have defined for ourselves. Human Resources initiatives across the Organization span a wide array of activities and are based on two cardinal principles – Performance and Commitment. Several contemporary practices inform the Human Resources initiatives at Indian Immunologicals, like Strategy Driven through Balance Scorecard, Performance and Commitment Linked Retention Bonus, Variable Pay, among others. Of course, life at Indian Immunologicals is not all work. The spirit is carried over at play as well.
