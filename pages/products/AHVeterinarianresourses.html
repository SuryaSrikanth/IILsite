                          SPV and GPV are often transmitted by the respiratory
                          route during close contact, but they may also enter
                          the body through other mucous membranes or abraded
                          skin. These viruses can be found in saliva, nasal and
                          conjunctival secretions, milk, urine and feces, as
                          well as in skin lesions and their scabs. Ulcers on the
                          mucous membranes are important sources of virus.
                          Whether SPV and GVP can be transmitted in semen or
                          embryos has not been established. Animals are most
                          contagious before neutralizing antibodies develop,
                          which occurs approximately a week after the onset of
                          clinical signs. Experimentally infected sheep and
                          goats can shed poxviruses in nasal, conjunctival and
                          oral secretions for 1 to 2 months, but shedding peaks
                          during the second week after inoculation, then
                          declines rapidly. Chronically infected carriers are
                          not seen.

                        <p>
                          SPV and GPV can also be spread by fomites or
                          transmitted mechanically by insects such as stable
                          flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), although the latter route
                          may be un-common. These viruses can remain infectious
                          for up to six months in shaded sheep pens. They may
                          also be found on the wool or hair for as long as three
                          months after infection, and possibly longer in scabs.
                          Whether the viruses in scabs are infectious is
                          unknown; these viruses are complexed with antibodies
                          and can be difficult to recover on tissue culture
                          media.

                            Incubation period is 8-13 days. It may be as short
                            as 4 days following experimental infection by
                            intradermal inoculation or mechanical transmission
                            by insects. Clinical signs vary from mild to severe,
                            depending on host factors (e.g. age, breed,
                            immunity) and viral factors (e.g. species
                            predilection and virulence of viral strain). In
                            apparent infections also occur.

                            Early clinical signs include a rise in rectal
                            temperature to above 40°C, development of macules
                            (small circumscribed areas of hyperaemia) in 2-5
                            days and later papules (hard swellings of between
                            0.5 and 1 cm in diameter) develop from macules. A
                            flat haemorrhagic form of capripox has been observed
                            in some breeds of European goat, in which all the
                            papules appear to coalesce over the body; this form
                            is always fatal.

                        These are Gram-positive, rod-shaped; anaerobic that can
                        produce environmentally-persistent spores in unfavorable
                        conditions. These spores can remain in the soil for
                        years in an inactive state, and return to their
                        infectious form when consumed by grazing livestock and
                        infect the large muscles of the animal where the
                        bacteria grow and produce large amount of gas.
                        Contaminated pasture is a predominant source of these
                        organisms, which are also found naturally in the
                        intestines of animals. Disease can occur over many years
                        in areas where there is soil or manure contamination
                        with the bacteria, and it is extremely difficult to
                        remove the spores from the environment.</span

                        Initially animal may develop fever, and the affected limb is hot to touch. The limb swells significantly, and the animal develops lameness on the affected leg. Crepitating, or the sensation of air under the skin, can be noticed as the area seems to crackle under pressure. Once clinical signs develop, the animal may only live a short while, sometimes as little as 12 hours. Occasionally, cattle will succumb to the disease without showing any symptoms at all, and only a post-mortem reveals the cause.</span

During post-mortem examination, a diagnosis is usually made very quickly, as the affected muscle is generally mottled with black patches. These patches represent dead tissue, killed by the toxins that the bacteria release when they infect a live tissue. If viewed under a microscope, small rod-like bacteria can be visualized to confirm the diagnosis.

                                Treatment is generally unsatisfactory due to the rapid progression of the disease; however penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment. Treatment is only effective in the early stages and as a control measure.
