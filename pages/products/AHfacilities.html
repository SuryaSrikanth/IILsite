          <p>The production facilities are designed with state of the art technologies following cGMP classifications providing the best environmental conditions for performing the operations. The process uses the latest biotechnology methods and is equipped with highly modern technologies. The personnel employed have the relevant qualification and are well trained to perform the operations efficiently complying with the regulatory requirements. Adequate storage facilities have been planned for the media, intermediates and finished products as per the requirements considering the lead times in testing. During design emphasis is laid on creating a safe working environment.</p>
          <br>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Media preparation</h5><p>A centralized media preparation facility for meeting the bulk and small scale requirements of all the antigen production units is established.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">FMD antigen</h5><p>The manufacturing process involves viral infections of large scale cell cultures followed by purification. The State of the art designs are incorporated to ensure high level of bio-containment(BSL-3). Suitable pressures are maintained in the areas for ensuring bio-containment and the exhaust air is decontaminated to prevent escape of virus into the environment. The material and personnel movements are well defined to prevent any escape of virus.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Rabies antigen</h5><p>Higher capacity bioreactors are installed for large scale suspension cell and viral cultures and innovative technology is adapted for higher yields and purification process. All the manipulations are carried out in closed vessels to ensure safety of the personnel.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Bacterial antigens</h5><p>The facility is designed for small, medium and large scale batch mode manufacture. The upstream and downstream facilities are well segregated for concentration and purification. The state of the art facility ensures compliance to cGMP requirements.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Antigens for Bovine, Canine, Ovine and Caprine vaccines</h5><p>The viral production is done on campaign basis in suspension and monolayer cell cultures. There is enough capacity for production and storage of viral antigens.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Blending and filling line for liquid vaccine in glass and polypropylene bottles</h5><p>The facility is designed for aseptic formulation, filling, inspection and packing. It uses the latest modular clean room construction and state of the art HVAC system. Two separate filling lines – one for polypropylene vials and the other for glass vials are in place. The design supports handling of multi product with volumes varying from 30 liters to 6250 liters and the pack sizes from 1 ml to 100 ml. The facility is equipped with blending vessels of different sizes from 100 ltrs to 6000 ltrs with online homogenizers to produce oil adjuvant and aqueous vaccine. The packaging unit has large cold stores attached for storing vaccines under quarantine.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Blending and filling of Freeze dried vaccines</h5><p>The facility is equipped with a vaccine blending area and filling line with freeze driers for bacterial and viral vaccines. Complete inspection of the freeze dried vials is carried out before sending to packaging facilities.</p>
          <h5 class="blue-text">Engineering services</h5><p>The services are centralized and monitored round the clock by experienced personnel. Backup power for all the facilities and uninterrupted power supply for critical equipments is in place. The quality parameters are monitored and maintained for all the services to ensure uninterrupted production.</p>
