                            Rabies is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get rabies when they are bitten by infected animals. At first there might not be any symptoms. But weeks, or even months after a bite, rabies can cause pain, fatigue, headaches, fever, and irritability. These are followed by seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. <br>
                            Human rabies is almost always fatal. <br>
                          <strong>Rabies vaccine</strong><br>
Rabies vaccine is given to people at high risk of rabies to protect them if they are exposed. It can also prevent the disease if it is given to a person after they have been exposed. <br>
Rabies vaccine is made from killed rabies virus. It cannot cause rabies.

                            <br>People at high risk of exposure to rabies, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, rabies laboratory workers, spelunkers, and rabies biologics production workers should be offered rabies vaccine. <br><br>
                            The vaccine should also be considered for: <br>
                            People whose activities bring them into frequent contact with rabies virus or with possibly rabid animals. <br>
                            International travelers who are likely to come in contact with animals in parts of the world where rabies is common. <br>
                            <br>
                            The pre-exposure schedule for rabies vaccination is 3 doses, given at the following times: <br>
Dose 1: As appropriate <br>
Dose 2: 7 days after Dose 1 <br>
Dose 3: 21 days or 28 days after Dose 1 <br>
For laboratory workers and others who may be repeatedly exposed to rabies virus, periodic testing for immunity is recommended, and booster doses should be given as needed. (Testing or booster doses are not recommended for travelers.) Ask your doctor for details.

They should also get another shot called Rabies Immune Globulin at the same time as the first dose. A person who has been previously vaccinated should get 2 doses of rabies vaccine – one right away and another on the 3rd day. Rabies Immune Globulin is not needed.</p>
